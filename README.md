# React + Vite + Tailwind + Storybook 8 + Airbnb Styleguide

This is a React Vite with latest Tailwind CSS project starter. My intention is to keep this project up-to-date on dependencies and latest practices (added over time) and emerging technologies, such as testing and accessibility.

In addition, it is being shipped with with Storybook V8 and leverages Airbnb Typescript styleguide with ESLint. 

# Yarn PnP and Typescript

This project uses the stable version of Yarn 2+. This means, this repo has `yarnrc.yml` but ignores everything else that is part of a Zero-install caching strategy. There are many advantages to use Zero installs but, since this is a starter, I've decided not apply here. If you decide to use this starter, I would recommend switching to Zero-installs given the benefits. [More on this topic here](https://yarnpkg.com/features/caching).
